This week, my focus was on setting up my development environment and planning my contributions for the upcoming internship period.

I completed the following tasks:

* Setup the internship blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
* Familiarized myself with the project's development environment.
* Researched and prepared a proposal for new exercises.

### Summary

Below is a quick summary of my initial steps and understanding:

#### Blog and Environment Setup

The first step was to create this blog to document my weekly progress. I used a standard **Jekyll** template hosted on **GitHub Pages**, which allows me to write posts in Markdown for easy updates.

After setting up the blog, I spent time exploring the main project repository. I focused on understanding the directory structure, the process for adding new exercises, and the common architecture they follow. This involved reading the documentation and examining existing exercises to understand how they integrate with the robotics simulation platform.

#### New Exercise Proposal

A significant part of the week was dedicated to brainstorming and outlining a proposal for new exercises. The goal is to enhance the autonomous driving collection. I researched potential scenarios that would provide valuable learning experiences and complement the existing exercises. The proposal includes learning objectives, technical requirements, and potential challenges for each new idea.

### Goals for Next Week

My primary goal is to finalize the new exercise proposal and submit it for review and feedback from my mentors. Once the proposal is approved, I plan to begin the preliminary development work on the first exercise.
