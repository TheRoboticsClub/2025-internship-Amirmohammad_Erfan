This week, my focus was on planning my contributions for the upcoming internship period and preparing detailed proposals for new exercises.

I completed the following tasks:

* Setup the internship blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
* Researched and prepared two proposals for new exercises.

### Summary

Below is a quick summary of my initial steps and understanding:

#### Blog Setup

The first step was to create this blog to document my weekly progress. I used a standard **Jekyll** template hosted on **GitHub Pages**, which allows me to write posts in Markdown for easy updates.

#### New Exercise Proposals

A significant part of the week was dedicated to brainstorming and outlining proposals for new exercises. Two proposals were submitted:

1. **Fundamentals of Image Processing** – Focused on building intuition through hands-on visual tasks like histogram equalization, noise filtering, and contrast enhancement.
2. **Realistic Robot Vision Scenario** – Aimed at developing perception skills in a simulated robotic environment with more complex, real-world tasks.

Each proposal includes learning objectives, technical requirements, and implementation challenges.

### Goals for Next Week

My primary goal is to finalize the scope of the selected proposal(s) based on feedback from my mentors. Once finalized, I plan to begin preliminary development work on the first exercise.
